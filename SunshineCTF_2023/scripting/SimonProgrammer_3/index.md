## Solution

- This solution is based on using <https://stackoverflow.com/a/66892766>
- It's didn't work by extracting `Rough   frequency:` in [SoX](https://sox.sourceforge.net/sox.html) output

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.fft import *
from scipy.io import wavfile

import requests

requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

BASE_URL = "https://simon3.web.2023.sunshinectf.games"

s = requests.Session()
# s.proxies = {"https": "http://127.0.0.1:8080"}
s.headers = {
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",

# https://stackoverflow.com/a/66892766
def wav2frequency(file):
    # Open the file and convert to mono
    sr, data = wavfile.read(file)
    if data.ndim > 1:
        data = data[:, 0]
    else:
        pass

    # Fourier Transform
    N = len(data)
    yf = rfft(data)
    xf = rfftfreq(N, 1 / sr)

    # Get the most dominant frequency and return it
    idx = np.argmax(np.abs(yf))
    freq = xf[idx]
    return freq


def paths2frequencies(paths: list[str]) -> list[float]:
    frequencies = []

    for path in paths:
        filename = path.replace("/static/", "")
        resp = s.get(f"{BASE_URL}/{path}")

        # save wav
        with open(f"wavs/{filename}", "wb") as f:
            f.write(resp.content)

        frequencies.append(wav2frequency(f"wavs/{filename}"))

    return frequencies


def get_frequencies() -> dict:

    return resp.json()

    resp = s.post(
        f"{BASE_URL}/flag",
        json=frequencies,

    return resp.text
