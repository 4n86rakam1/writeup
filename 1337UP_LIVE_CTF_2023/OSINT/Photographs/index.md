I should track down the photographer of this photo.
I downloaded this image and save it with the name picture.jpg, and executed [exiftool](https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool).

```console
$ exiftool picture.jpg
(snip)
Creator                         : fl0pfl0p5
(snip)
```

I got image creator fl0pfl0p5.

Used [sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) due to search fl0pfl0p5's social media account.

```console
$ sherlock fl0pfl0p5
