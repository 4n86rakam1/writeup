## Solution

First, I guessed the attached enc.txt file was a Base* encoded string because it was all uppercase.
I tried decoding with each `From Base`, `From Base32`, `From Base45`, `From Base58`, `From Base62`, `From Base64` and `From Base85` Operations in [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), and found that the `From Base32` decoded result is `%2E%2E%2E%2E...` string.

result:
